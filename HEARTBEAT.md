# HEARTBEAT.md

## Memory Maintenance (every few days)

1. Read recent memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files (last 7 days)
2. Identify significant events, lessons, insights
3. Update MEMORY.md with distilled learnings
4. Remove outdated info from MEMORY.md
5. Clean up error-log.md if entries are resolved/become obsolete

## Health Checks (rotate through, 2-4 times per day)

- **Emails** - Any urgent unread messages?
- **Calendar** - Upcoming events in next 24-48h?
- **Monitoring** - Are services healthy? (Portainer, n8n, Qdrant, Code-Server, Overseer)
- **Weather** - Relevant if going out?

## Proactive Work

- Review and update MEMORY.md based on recent learnings
- Check on projects (git status in stack/, swarm/, agents/)
- Commit and push own changes
- Read and organize memory files

## When to Stay Quiet (HEARTBEAT_OK)

- Late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent

## When to Reach Out
