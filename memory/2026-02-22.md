# 2026-02-22 Memory Log

## Memory Maintenance (07:29 AM)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**What Was Done:**

### MEMORY.md Updates:
1. **Added Coding Agent Workflow Correction** (2026-02-21 entry)
   - Documented user correction about prioritizing Claude Code and Kimi
   - Added workflow priority order: Claude Code → Kimi → sessions_spawn
   - Included usage guidelines for each tool

2. **Removed Duplicate cAdvisor Entry**
   - Cleaned up duplicate investigation content in MEMORY.md
   - Kept only the updated version with both root causes identified
   - Removed 37 lines of redundant information

### Error-Log.md Cleanup:
1. **Removed Resolved Entries** (3 entries removed)
   - Kimi WriteFile infinite loop (confirmed working, documented in MEMORY.md)
   - docker-check script regex bug (fixed and committed)
   - coding agent workflow correction (resolved and documented in MEMORY.md)
   - cAdvisor invalid storage_driver (resolved, see MEMORY.md for current blocker)
   - cAdvisor invalid disable_metrics (resolved, see MEMORY.md for current blocker)

**Significant Events from Recent Memory Files:**

**From 2026-02-21:**
- Coding agent workflow correction received from user
- Docker services healthy (12 containers, 13 days uptime)
- Skills verification: 6 working skills
- Cloudflare config discovery (dashboard vs local file)

**From 2026-02-20:**
- Skills cleanup (reduced to 7 working skills)
- Nexus authentication implementation complete
- Ping-Kimi web app deployed
- memsearch vs QMD comparison completed
- memsearch added to all 6 repositories

**Lessons Learned:**
- Use Claude Code and Kimi directly for coding (not sessions_spawn)
- Cloudflared config must be managed via Dashboard (not local file)
- cAdvisor has Docker API version mismatch (still unresolved)

## QMD Embed Update (04:58 AM)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Details:**
- Triggered by cron reminder
- Embedded 43 chunks from 12 documents
- Processing time: 1m 12s
- Model: embeddinggemma (2.6GB)
- Mode: CPU (CUDA detected but failed to build)

**Performance:**
- 1.4 KB/s embedding speed
- Incremental update (only new/changed files)
- Much faster than first-time embed (7m)

**Notes:**
- CPU fallback expected for this VPS without GPU
- No issues, embeddings updated successfully
