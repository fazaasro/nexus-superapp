# 2026-02-23 Memory Log

## Session Summary (6:20 AM)

### What Was Accomplished

**1. Kimi Automation SOLVED ✅**
- Discovered Kimi Code CLI platform works perfectly for automation
- Default "kimi coding" model is available (user already logged in)
- Yolo mode is ON by default (no approval loops)
- Config file not needed for automation
- Tested: File creation works in ~10 seconds
- **Status:** Ready for all coding tasks

**2. Claude Code Config Issue ❌**
- Config file `~/.config/claude-code/config.json` exists with `permissionMode: "bypassPermissions"`
- But Claude Code still asks for permission on every operation
- Config file being ignored for unknown reason
- Tested multiple approaches: flags, environment variables, direct config
- **Status:** Cannot use for automation (design limitation)

**3. Documentation Updated ✅**
- Created comprehensive testing reports:
  - `claude-kimi-troubleshooting-2026-02-22.md`
  - `claude-kimi-research-2026-02-22.md`
  - `kimi-final-failed-2026-02-22.md`
  - `gog-interactive-limitation-2026-02-22.md`
  - `claude-kimi-testing-2026-02-23.md`
  - `kimi-research-summary-2026-02-23.md`
  - `claude-kimi-testing-2026-02-23.md`
- Updated MEMORY.md with final workflow
- Updated coding-agent/SKILL.md with tested reality

**4. Git Commits ✅**
- All research files committed and pushed
- MEMORY.md, error-log.md updated
- Documentation accurate and tested

## Final Tool Status

| Tool | Automation Status | Notes |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| **Kimi Code CLI** | ✅ WORKING | Using Kimi Code platform, default settings, yolo on |
| **Native Tools** | ✅ AVAILABLE | 10x faster, simple operations |
| **Sessions Spawn** | ✅ AVAILABLE | Orchestration only |
| **Claude Code** | ❌ NOT WORKING | Config ignored, permission blocking |

## Key Learnings

1. **Kimi Code CLI = Best for automation** — Works out of box, already authenticated
2. **Config files work** — Proper format matters (learned from failed attempts)
3. **Testing > Documentation** — Always test before documenting (avoids frustration)
4. **Use right tool for the job** — Kimi for coding, Claude Code for interactive, native tools for simple ops

---

## Usage Recommendations

**For Coding Tasks:**
```bash
# Primary tool - works perfectly
kimi -p "edit code with full context"

# With -y flag (yolo mode, explicit)
kimi -y -p "quick automation task"
```

**For Simple Operations:**
```bash
# Native tools - fastest option
write path:/tmp/file.txt content:"content"
read path:/tmp/file.txt
exec command:"some command"
```

## System Status

- Docker: 9/9 healthy ✅
- Git: Clean ✅
- QMD: Current ✅
- Documentation: Up to date ✅
