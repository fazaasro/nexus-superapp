# 2026-02-16 — Daily Log

## Morning Session

### Workspace Reorganization
- Reorganized ~/.openclaw/workspace/ from 17 root markdowns to 6 core files + docs/ structure
- Created docs/architecture/, docs/setup/, docs/status/, docs/implementation/
- Moved all non-core docs into appropriate subdirectories
- Cleaned up EOF file

### Home Directory Reorganization
- Reorganized /home/ai-dev/ from scattered files to structured layout
- Created /home/ai-dev/scripts/ for system scripts
- Consolidated 3 caddy directories into /home/ai-dev/caddy/
- Created /home/ai-dev/certificates/ for caddy-ca.crt
- Moved all MD files from /home/ai-dev/ to /home/ai-dev/stack/docs/
- Deleted old installation files:
  - google-cloud-cli-linux-x86_64.tar.gz (195MB)
  - get-docker.sh
  - micro (13MB)
  - 5 .claude.json.backup files
- Removed empty levy_workspace/

### Stack Organization
- Reorganized /home/ai-dev/stack/
- Created docs/setup/ (14 setup docs)
- Created docs/status/ (2 status reports)
- Created docs/security/ (SECURITY.md)
- Moved scripts to scripts/ (deploy.sh, fix_dns.sh, status.sh, setup.sh)

### coding-agent Skill Update
- Updated /home/ai-dev/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/coding-agent/SKILL.md
- Added comprehensive Kimi CLI documentation
- Enhanced Claude Code section with full flags and patterns
- Updated examples to show all agents (Codex, Kimi, Claude Code)
- Added transparency rule (#2) for explicit agent spawning
- Updated metadata to include "kimi" in anyBins requirement

### Tool Discovery
- Kimi CLI already installed at /home/ai-dev/.local/bin/kimi
- Kimi config at ~/.kimi/config.toml
- Default model: kimi-code/kimi-for-coding
- Capabilities: image_in, video_in, thinking
- Claude Code installed at /home/ai-dev/.local/bin/claude
- Codex, OpenCode, Pi not installed

## Learning from Article

Read "How I Taught OpenClaw to Never Repeat a Mistake" — three-layer memory system:
1. Error Log (auto-capture) - memory/error-log.md
2. Local Search with QMD - index everything locally
3. Heartbeat-Driven Memory Maintenance - periodic distillation

## Next Steps

- Install QMD for local search ✅
- Create HEARTBEAT.md with memory maintenance tasks ✅
- Update MEMORY.md with today's learnings ✅
- Set up auto-capture error logging behavior ✅
- Complete QMD embedding generation ✅

## QMD Setup Complete ✅

- Installed via bun + installed tsx locally
- Collections created:
  - workspace: 54 files
  - stack: 18 files  
  - skills: 11 files
- Total: 83 documents indexed
- All content has embeddings (BM25 + vector)
- Search tested: working fast
- Ready for use: `qmd search "query"` or `qmd vsearch "query"`

## Learning

- QMD skills collection needed absolute path (~/.openclaw/workspace/skills) not relative
- tsx needed locally in workspace for QMD to work
- First-time embedding takes 7m on CPU (one-time cost)
- Subsequent embeds only process new/changed files (fast)
